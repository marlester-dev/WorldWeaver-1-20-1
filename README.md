**WorldWeaver**, or *WoVer* for short, is a Fabric utility mod
for Minecraft that aims to streamline common modding tasks, 
particularly those related to world generation. Serving as the 
successor to BCLib, WoVer intends to eventually take its place.
Embracing Minecraft's data-driven methodology for world 
generation, it strives to amplify the significance of data 
elements. Moreover, WoVer seeks to seamlessly integrate with 
the vanilla game, other mods, and world generating datapacks.

**Please note** that this mod is still in early development and is not yet ready for use.
